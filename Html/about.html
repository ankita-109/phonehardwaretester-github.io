    Mobile applications have become more than entertainment stuff in our lives. Such applications have become increasingly pervasive in such a way that humans are quite dependent on mobile devices and their applications. 
    According to the research conducted by the Statistics website portal, the number of mobile users can reach five billion marks by 2019. So, it’s important to check that our mobile phones are functioning properly.
    It becomes very difficult to look for a system that will ease the work of testing the device. The Device Tester App helps in testing the device i.e., mobile phones, and lets you know whether the device is working in the way it was intended to work. 
    This system checks the phone’s hardware, sensors, and components, to make sure everything is operating properly.<br><br>
